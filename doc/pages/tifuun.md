# TIFUUN Collaborators: Welcome!

Are you a TIFUUN collaborator?
Nice to meet you!
I hope RAIMAD will become useful in your work.

## TIFUUN github organisation

Are you already part of the
[TIFUUN organisation on github](https://github.com/tifuun)?
If not, please ask someone to add you!
This is where all RAIMAD-related development happens.

### Public and Private repositories

Would you like to develop components for RAIMAD
and share them with others?
Then you can add your components
to one of the two existing repositories:
[rai_compos_pub](https://github.com/tifuun/rai_compos_pub)
or
[rai_compos_priv](https://github.com/tifuun/rai_compos_pub)
.

The `rai_compos_pub` repository is publicly available:
anyone in the world can read your code.
The `rai_compos_priv`, however, is only visible to
other TIFUUN collaborators.
You can choose which of the two access policies is more
appropriate for your work.

If you want, you can also [create and your package](packaging.md).
However, this is sadly a bit of a tedious process,
especially if you are not familiar with Python packaging.
So you can save yourself a lot of headache by instead
contributing to one of the existing repos!
